# Frontend Takehome Assessment

This is an exercise that will give you a glimpse of the typical day-to-day challenges that we tackle at LCI!

You will be recreating a multiselect dropdown component, packed with several features which will be explained in detail in the acceptance criteria.

At Letâ€™s Code It, we deliver solutions with a future-focused, pixel-perfect mindset. So pay extra attention to the user experiences, and the design details provided below.

## Design Guide:

## Acceptance Criteria
- For the multiselect dropdown's initial state:
  - the multiselect should have a placeholder text "Select..."
- When a user types a non-empty string in the input box, the component should query the list of matching results from the `getColors` API.
  - For sanitizing the search string, a text-to-lowercase transformation should suffice.
  - The UI should be performant, and not incur too many promise calls. In other words, we do not want to fetch the list of matching results for every time the input box changes gets updated. Think of a way to limit the number of times `getColor` is called on search input's change listener.
  - The multiselect should fetch and display the results from the `getColor` API.
  - We should also have an appropriate empty state for a 0 result set from the `getColor` API.

TODO:
- The list of options should filter out the list of that are already selected
- Clicking on the selected token should remove the option from the selection list.
